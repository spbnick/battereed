Battereed
=========

Battereed is a battery adapter with a reed switch. It's useful for controlling
battery-powered devices which don't have a switch of their own, like car key
fobs. Put a CR1620 battery inside, and then you can put it in place of a
CR2032 battery. After that you can control the device's power with a magnet,
which could be embedded into [a mechanical switch][kona-key-switch].
